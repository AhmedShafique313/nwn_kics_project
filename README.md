# Image Annotation
Image annotation is labeling image and drawing lines on images. However you can done it manually but I did this using `opencv` with is rich python library used for computer vision and image processing. You'll find the project and learning material of annotation using opencv python. 
- Where is located?
Go to the folder named as `New folder`. You will found `assets` folder and other .py and .ipynb file. All these files containing learning material related to opencv-python annotation.
Here are some outputs related to opencv python
