# Image Annotation
`27/6/2024`
Image annotation is labeling image and drawing lines on images. However you can done it manually but I did this using `opencv` with is rich python library used for computer vision and image processing. You'll find the project and learning material of annotation using opencv python. 
- Where is located?
Go to the folder named as `New folder`. You will found `assets` folder and other .py and .ipynb file. All these files containing learning material related to opencv-python annotation.
Here are some outputs related to opencv python

# Image Augmentation
The image augmentation is a process of generating dataset by using original dataset by zooming, adjusting brightness, flipping, rotating and bluring the dataset. 
`Image Augmentation` task I used `opencv-python` and generates multiple images by single image. 
Here are followings:
