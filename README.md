# Image Annotation
`27/6/2024`
Image annotation is labeling image and drawing lines on images. However you can done it manually but I did this using `opencv` with is rich python library used for computer vision and image processing. You'll find the project and learning material of annotation using opencv python. 
- Where is located?
Go to the folder named as `New folder`. You will found `assets` folder and other .py and .ipynb file. All these files containing learning material related to opencv-python annotation.
Here are some outputs related to opencv python

# Image Augmentation
The image augmentation is a process of generating dataset by using original dataset by zooming, adjusting brightness, flipping, rotating and bluring the dataset. 
`Image Augmentation` task I used `opencv-python` and generates multiple images by single image. 
Here are followings:
- Original Image:
- Flipped Horizontal
- Flipped Vertical
- Rotated 90 degree
- Brightness level
- Gaussian Blur

# Auto Image Annotation using Yolo v5
In this project I used `Yolov5` from `huggingface` website. This is pre-trained yolov5 I used for image annotation and for object detection. It annotate the image and then detect it using yolov5 technology and tell us what is it?

# Sniper Rifle GunShot Project
The folder named with `scipy_audio` is located for this project. Throughout this project we pass the .wav file to the program and it converts it to plot image using scipy features.
